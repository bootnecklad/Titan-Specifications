  Rewire part of register card
		allow for ALU A+B inputs on register card

  Get new backplane board + connectors, EEPROMs for microcode testing, any extra ICs (priority encoder)
  Make backplane
		Has space for 4 cards: Front Panel Driver, Diagnostics card and Interrupts+I/O with one SPARE

  Make front panel driver card
  Make control card
  Make Diagnostic LEDs card
  Make interrupts + I/O card

  Microcode + Bring up  ; titan runs once this is complete
		Easy once EEPROMs have been accquired

  Make chassis deeper + modify psu heat sink
		This makes space for extra cards and better air flow.
