Wire Wrap control card
Make new backplane - Space for 4 extra cards: Front Panel Driver, Diagnostics card, Interrupts+I/O and one SPARE(future expansion)	
Make front panel driver card
Microcode + Bring up  ; titan runs once this is complete
	Easy once EEPROMs have been accquired
Make chassis deeper + modify psu heat sink
	This makes space for extra cards and better air flow.
Make interrupts + I/O card
Make Diagnostic LEDs card
	Slightly optional, looks good!
		
		
DONE:

Got backplane connectors
Got EPROMs + priority encoders
Register card rewired to allow ALU A+B inputs on register card
Soldered control card
