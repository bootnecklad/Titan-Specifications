LOCAL(n) = stack + n

INT_TO_DEL

DEL -- the name of the system -- needs to convert it into DEL (tagged ptr) FORMAT



PRIM_PRINT() ?!           
bnl, that is a SYSCALL    
print the top of the stack
write it to a serial port 




GC_IF_NEEDED(n) says "i want n bytes of space, would you be able to give it to me?"


PUSH_CLOSURE(1);
bnl, doesn't matter, the actual thing it does is take an "address" which is the 1 there, and saves it to the heap
at the current heap pointer                                                                                      
and then pushes that pointer to the stack                                                                        

GLOBAL(0) = PEEK();

bnl, there's a special segment of memory, an array, called the global list





RESET_STACK();
SAVE_TOP saves the top of the stack to the current place we're at in the heap 


PRIM_EQ();                                     
checks if the two items on the stack are equal?

 TOP() = REF(1);
bnl, set the top of the stack to the value at the top of the stack's address plus 1
bnl, take the top of the stack, which is a pointer
visit that pointer/address whatever, move an offset of 1
take that value you find, and set it to the top
