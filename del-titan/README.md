The register layout and memory map had to be defined before code could be written. [Found here](https://github.com/bootnecklad/Titan-Specifications/blob/master/del-titan/Conventions.md)

## But why? ##

BECAUSE LISP IS AWESOME AND TITAN IS AWESOME, IT IS ONLY RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULD BE UNITED TOGETHER.
