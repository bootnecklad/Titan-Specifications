# Titan Assembler #

## Description ##

An Assembler for Titan written in scheme.

## Conventions ##

All conventions are in the specification which can be found [here](https://github.com/bootnecklad/Titan-Specifications/blob/master/Specifications.md)

## But bootnecklad there are assemblers out there already, why? ##

Because I can't keep track of them all the time or update them when I change something that annoys said writers of assemblers.
